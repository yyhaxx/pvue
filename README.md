After joined Google in 2016, he tirelessly works as Angular evangelist to help developers in China's enterprise and open source communities to be successful with Angular.

In August, he posted some articles on [Zhi hu](ww.zhihu.com)(Chinese Quora equivalent website) to compare similarities of Vue and Anguar, he criticised Vue and blame it 'copies' ideas from other libraries without innovation itself.

Vue's creator [Evan you](https://github.com/yyx990803) send direct message to Igor Minarï¼ˆhttps://github.com/IgorMinar) (Aaron's direct manager) to report this issue and posted the screenshot of their conversation via his webo account. Evan's supporters started to bully Aaron online and even threaten to take his life.

Now it is said Aaron resigned his job and he deleted all his articles on Zhi hu.
